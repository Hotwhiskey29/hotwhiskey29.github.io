            <p class="blog">I've been coding non-stop for the past 1-2 weeks and I've made huge improvements to<span style="color: #4d588d;"> POKÉMON: ICE COLD</span>! It's mostly graphical changes since they were ripped sprites from Pokémon FireRed, and honestly it looks way better now that it's in my style! But I think today will be the last day I'll be coding something in a while... I'll be visiting a friend of mine for a week, and then I will have to pre-study for a few days before my classes begin... I won't be able to code for at least 3 months! I'm actually really upset cause I was happy I finally had the urge to code, I hope I can have that urge back once I'm back home, I've got really nice ideas for my games! Other than graphical improvements, I also did some battle codes, the battle system is not finished yet, and I'm not really a fan of coding it... code's a mess...<br>In the past, I always shared a "demo" when I was gonna take some break (They had like 2 mins of gameplay in total), I won't be doing that now, if I ever want to release some kind of demo, the gameplay will have to have 20-30 mins of gameplay and it should also have some kind of cliffhanger rather than just ending it at the last place I coded... Anyway, I'm not really the kind of person that likes to keep everything hidden for a long time, so I'll be sharing some screenshots!</p>
