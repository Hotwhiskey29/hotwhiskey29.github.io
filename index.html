            <h1>First Post: Why?</h1>
            <p class="blog">I've decided to make this little website for game dev purposes, I code whenever I feel like it but I still felt like I should have something to show my progress. My games are usually gone after spending months to create a 5 minute gameplay, but that's usually because I change ideas or can't continue coding due life... So, a little more about this website, the code is literally being held by duck tapes and bubblegums, I have no idea how to make websites, so I watched a few tutorial, and frankesteined some stuff to create this website... The home page will have everything, but if you're only interested in one game, they do have their own pages.<span style="color: #994b48; outline: black;"> Everything this website has right now might change in the future (like the logo, the style, and the background hedgehogs even though they're really cute lol).</span></p>
